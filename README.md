DinoGame

Gamemechanics:
1. General idea:
	-Sidescroller + Jump 'n' Run
	-every character has its own ability
	-multiplayer mechanic, so that you can jump on enemy player heads to let them jump into death
	  --> Stomp mechanic is a thing
	-maybe level design oriented to time travelling
	-health bars for each players (maybe in the screen corners)

2. Player Abilities:
	-Dash, move a step fast forward on horizontal axis
	-Fireball, just for destroying terrain
	-Camouflage, get invisible to enemies (AI) and to human rivals (-->loading ability)
	-getting smaller, shrink to a smaller size for better dodging, maybe shortcuts (being small over time with cd)

3. Passive terrainability:
	-one Dino can swim
	-one Dino can walk through thorns (roses or similar)
	-one Dino can jump on clouds
	-one Dino can walk through fire
